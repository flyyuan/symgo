# SymGo

<!-- You can add a logo if you have one -->

SymGo is a symbolic mathematics library for the Go programming language, inspired by the renowned Python library, [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy). It aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for symbolic mathematics in Go, leveraging the concurrency and efficiency of the language.

## Overview

SymGo is an open-source symbolic mathematics library for Go. It's designed with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, both for interactive and programmatic applications.

## Features

- Basic symbolic arithmetic
- Algebraic manipulations
- Calculus operations (differentiation, integration)
- Linear algebra functionalities
- ... (and more to come!)

## Installation

### Recommended Method

The recommended installation method is through Go's package manager:

```bash
go get github.com/flyyuan/symgo
```

### From Source

To install SymGo from GitHub source:

1. Clone the SymGo repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/flyyuan/symgo.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install:
```bash

$ go install .
```

For more detailed installation options, refer to the [official documentation](link_to_your_documentation).

## Usage

Here's a basic example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/flyyuan/symgo"
)

func main() {
    x, y := symgo.Symbols("x y")
    expr := x.Add(y.Mul(symgo.Integer(2)))
    fmt.Println(expr)
}
```

For more detailed usage and examples, refer to the [official documentation](link_to_your_documentation).
